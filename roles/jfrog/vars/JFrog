# Next, download and add the GPG key with the following command:

    wget -qO - https://api.bintray.com/orgs/jfrog/keys/gpg/public.key | apt-key add -

# Next, add the JFrog Artifactory repository with the following command

    echo "deb https://jfrog.bintray.com/artifactory-debs bionic main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jfrog.list

# Once the repository is added, update the repository and install JFrog Artifactory with the following command:

    apt-get update -y
    apt-get install jfrog-artifactory-oss -y

# Once the installation has been completed successfully, you should get the following output:

# Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

   # Next, you will need to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for JFrog. First, install the Nginx webserver with the following command:
   
        apt-get install nginx -y

   # After installing Nginx, create a new Nginx virtual host configuration file with the following command:
   
        vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/jfrog.conf
       
   # Add the following lines:
   
        upstream jfrog {
          server 127.0.0.1:8082 weight=100 max_fails=5 fail_timeout=5;
        }
        
        server {
          listen          80;
          server_name     jfrog.a3tech.com;
        
          location / {
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_pass http://jfrog/;
          }
        }
   # Save and close the file then activate the Nginx virtual host with the following command:
   
        ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/jfrog.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

   # Next, verify the Nginx for any syntax error with the following command:
   
        nginx -t
    
   # You should see the following output:
   
        nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
        nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   
   # Finally, restart the Nginx service to implement the changes:
   
        systemctl restart nginx

 * At this point, Nginx is configured to serve JFrog site. You can now proceed to the next step *
 
# Secure JFrog with Let's Encrypt SSL

   # It is recommended to secure JFrog with Let's Encrypt SSL. First, add the Certbot repository with the following command:
   
        apt-get install software-properties-common -y
        add-apt-repository ppa:ahasenack/certbot-tlssni01-1875471
   
   # Next, update the repository and install the Certbot client with the following command:

        apt-get update -y
        apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y

   # Once the Certbot client is installed, run the following command to download and install Let's Encrypt SSL for your website:

        certbot --nginx -d jfrog.linuxbuz.com

            IMPORTANT NOTES:
             - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
               /etc/letsencrypt/live/jfrog.linuxbuz.com/fullchain.pem
               Your key file has been saved at:
               /etc/letsencrypt/live/jfrog.linuxbuz.com/privkey.pem
               Your cert will expire on 2020-09-07. To obtain a new or tweaked
               version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
               with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
               your certificates, run "certbot renew"
             - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
               configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
               secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
               also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
               making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
